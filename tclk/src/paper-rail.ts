// The paper rail: a settlement rail that settles nothing.
//
// ⚠️ IT HOLDS NO VALUE AND CANNOT. Every other rail is backed by something that
// arbitrates — a chain enforcing "reveal the secret or the timelock refunds", a contract
// neither party can override. This one is backed by a note on a chat service that holds
// no funds, executes nothing, and says so itself. Its records are world-writable: anyone
// can overwrite any status on any contract, and nothing here moves a coin, because there
// is no coin.
//
// It exists for one honest job: letting the whole choreography run end to end, on the
// real venue, between two processes that share no memory — so the protocol can be
// demonstrated and exercised before a rail that holds value exists. Treat a `paper` deal
// as a rehearsal. `verifyLock` returning true means a string is present in a namespace a
// stranger could have written; it is evidence of a rehearsal, never of a payment.
//
// Two-party fair exchange without an arbiter is impossible (Even–Yacobi; Pagnia–Gärtner),
// so this is not a weaker escrow — it is not escrow. A rail that holds value needs an
// arbiter, which is what the on-chain rails in SPEC.md §5 are for.
